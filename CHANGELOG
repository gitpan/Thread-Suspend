0.02	30 August 2003
	Added methods/subroutines "iambusy" and "iamdone" to mark sections
	of code in a thread that may not be suspended.  Added tests for this
	new functionality and adapted the MANIFEST accordingly.

	Added note to documentation to tell that if you're using "iambusy"
	and "iamdone" in threads, you don't need working signals, which would
	make Thread::Suspend usable on a lot more platforms.

	Now uses load.pm to reduce the number of subroutines loaded at compile
	time.  Changed all package lexicals to our, which means they are now
	also available externally, which may or may not be a good thing.
	Added dependency to load.pm.

	Fixed some documentation errors.

0.01	21 August 2003
	First version of Thread::Suspend.
